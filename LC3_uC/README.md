# Design and Verification of 16 bit Non pipelined LC3 RISC Microprocessor

Using SV enhancements for DFV. Developed a reusable constrained random stimulus, coverage driven layered verification environment architecture in System Verilog along with Assertion Based 
Verification techniques. Was further extended to understand benefits of adopting Universal Verification Methodology. In the process also learnt about VLSI Design and Verification flows, 
functional coverage, assertions based verification. This helps as a foundation before exploring UVM.
