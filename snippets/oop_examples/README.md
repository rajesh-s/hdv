# Examples of OOP in SV

1. class A - Base class
    static 
    protected
    global
    local

   class B - without relation
     Display all vars

   class C
     Display all vars

2. class A
   
   class B extends A 

   class C 
    A a = new
    B b = new

3. class A 
   <vars>
	< access the other vars>
   class B extends A 
    <different local vars>
    < access the other vars>
    class C extends B
    <different local vars>
	< access the other vars>
    module
  d1


4. Define a class with dynamic array "a". Randomize class properties such that each element of the dynamic array has values greater than 7.

5. Define a class with variable a and b with size of 3. Randomize class properties such that b can have a value of 4 or 5 whereas a should always be zero.

6. Define a class with variable a and b with size of 3. Randomize class properties 10 times such that a should have value b/w 5 to 7 and b should be either 4 or 6
  
7. Define a class with variable a and b with size of 3. Randomize class properties 8 times such that each time a holds a different value

8. Declare class A,B and C. Class C has 3 different variables p,q and r. Randomize class C properties inside class A and transfer randomized class C properties  
   to B.
9. Define a class with vars A and B. Generate random values 5 times and print them. Overwrite the value of A to 55 after randomization

10. Define a class with vars u,v and w. Generate 10 random values of u and v with the fixed value of w = 70.
